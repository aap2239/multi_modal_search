Ducks are birds known for their distinctive waddling gait and broad, flat bill.
They are highly adaptable and can live in both fresh and saltwater environments.
Ducks are omnivores, feeding on aquatic plants, insects, and small fish.
Many duck species are migratory, traveling long distances between breeding and wintering grounds.
Female ducks usually have duller plumage than males, helping them blend into their surroundings while nesting.
