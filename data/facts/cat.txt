Cats are known for their agility and balance, often able to leap multiple times their body length.
They have retractable claws, which help them to climb and hunt effectively.
Cats communicate through various vocalizations, body language, and scent marking.
They are natural predators and often exhibit a 'play' behavior with their prey.
Domestic cats typically sleep for 12-16 hours a day, more than most other animals.
