Horses are social animals, often forming strong bonds with others in their herd.
They have a unique digestive system that allows them to subsist primarily on grasses.
Horses can sleep both standing up and lying down, thanks to a special locking mechanism in their legs.
They have a wide range of coat colors and patterns, each with specific names like bay, chestnut, and palomino.
Horses have been domesticated for over 5,000 years and have been used for transportation, agriculture, and sports.
